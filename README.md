# PHP Blog
Creating a blog using _PHP_. For this blog, I will be creating different CRUDs needed for the functionality of the blog itself.

## Tutorial
To create this system, I'm following [John's tutorial](https://ilovephp.jondh.me.uk/en/tutorial/make-your-own-blog), which is an easy way to learn PHP.

***NOTE***: *Although this tutorial is an easy and quick way of learning PHP, it's recommended to have, at least, basic knowledge in programming; the way the steps are taught may not be the best for people without prior programming knowledge.*

## Tools
1. We'll need `XAMPP` for creating the system; any web server may be usable.
    1. `XAMPP` installs PHP and other settings needed for the system to work.
2. The tutorial itself explains that for the DB, we'll be using **SQLite**.
    1. If `XAMPP` is being used, `MySQL` can be used. The connection for this db isn't taught, though.
3. Any code editor. I use Visual Studio Code (personal preference).
